# rtlomni

rtlomni is a software to sniff RF packets using a RTLSDR dongle in order to analysis Omnipod protocol.
Hope this could help and contribute to https://github.com/openaps/openomni to create a closed loop using a glucose sensor like Freestyle Libre and the excelent Omnipod Insulin Pump instead of the 8 year old tube systems which are currenly only working as a closed loop solution.


##Credits
This work is mainly based on https://github.com/ps2/omnipod_rf
SDR demodulation and signal processing is based on excellent https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp/

## Setting up

To use rtlomni we recommend using a Raspberry Pi together with a RTLSDR dongle.
